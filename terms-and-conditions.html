        <h2>2. Platform Purpose</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>2.1 Health Optimization:</strong> The platform assists Users by analyzing the nutritional content of food products available at restaurants, aiding them in making informed choices that contribute to their personal health goals.</li>
            <li><strong>2.3 Encouraging Transparency:</strong> By offering comprehensive information about food items, HungrX motivates food providers, such as restaurants, to improve the transparency of their offerings, fostering better practices in nutritional disclosure and sustainability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Platform Functionality</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>3.1 Calorie and Nutritional Analysis:</strong> HungrX provides Users with nutritional information for meals based on publicly available sources, including restaurant menus. This helps Users make informed decisions based on their health objectives, such as weight loss or weight gain.</li>
            <li><strong>3.2 Application Features:</strong> Users can:
                <ul>
                    <li>Opt for a Premium Plan, offering enhanced features such as detailed nutritional breakdowns, advanced calorie management, and personalized recommendations.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>3.3 Food Information Capture:</strong> The Application analyzes the calorie value and nutritional content of food items.</li>
            <li><strong>3.4 Scoring Criteria:</strong> The scoring system used by HungrX is based on three key factors:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Nutritional Value:</strong> Analyzes the calorie and macronutrient content of food items.</li>
                    <li><strong>User Preferences:</strong> Customizes food recommendations based on the User’s health goals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Publicly Available Data:</strong> Relies on publicly available nutritional information from restaurants and other sources. Future enhancements may consider additional factors such as the degree of food processing.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>3.5 Public Data Disclaimer:</strong> HungrX relies on publicly available data for its food recommendations. While we aim to provide accurate and up-to-date information, the data may not always be accurate or exhaustive. The Company disclaims all liability concerning the accuracy of third-party sources.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>3.6 Non-Medical Nature of Services</h2>
        <p>
            While HungrX provides nutritional and calorie analysis for better health choices, the information is for general wellness purposes only and should not be interpreted as medical advice. The Application does not diagnose, treat, or cure any health conditions. Users should consult with a healthcare professional for specific medical guidance.
        </p>
        <p class="important">
            The platform provides an initial analysis that enables the users to be aware of the composition of the food products they use daily, but does not guarantee the user optimum health. The services offered by the platform do not, in any way, constitute medical recommendation.

            <li><strong>4.3</strong> Evaluations and scoring are limited to food and nutritional products and do not extend to other categories.</li>
            <li><strong>4.4</strong> Evaluations are based on public information and are not substitutes for FDA or state regulatory inspections.</li>

            <li><strong>5.2</strong> The platform disclaims liability for errors in the database, including data related to product composition. The database evolves based on supplier and manufacturer updates.</li>
            <li><strong>5.3</strong> Users are advised to cross-check food item composition directly to ensure accuracy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Evaluation Disclaimer</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>6.1</strong> HungrX does not guarantee relevance, completeness, or accuracy of risk evaluations related to ingredients and additives. Evaluations are based on publicly available data and aim to assist users in making informed dietary choices.</li>
            <li><strong>6.2</strong> Evaluations are based on current science, but updates to studies or regulations may not be immediately reflected. Users are encouraged to conduct their own research and due diligence.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Medical Disclaimer</h2>
        <ul>
