          <h2>6. Other Tracking Technologies Like Web Beacons</h2>
          <p>
              Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors on a website. We may use other
              similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called “tracking pixels”
              or “clear gifs”). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enables us to
              recognize when someone has visited our websites or opened an e-mail including these. In
              many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and hence,
              declining cookies will impair their functioning.
          </p>

          <h2>7. Update and Review</h2>
          <p>
              We make changes to our Cookie Policy from time to time. Therefore, please revisit this
              cookie policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies.
