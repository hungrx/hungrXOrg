            <h2>8. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</h2>

                not intended for individuals under the age of 13. We take measures to prevent the collection of
                Personal Data from children without parental consent.</p>

            <h3>8.1 Age Restrictions</h3>
            <p>Our Services are specifically designed for users aged 18 and older, and minors aged 13 to 17 are
                permitted to use the platform only with parental consent and supervision. We do not knowingly
                collect Personal Data from children under the age of 18. If we learn that we have inadvertently
                collected Personal Data from a child under this age, we will take immediate steps to delete such

                Personal Data, please contact us immediately. We will take appropriate measures to delete such
                information in accordance with applicable laws and ensure that no further data collection occurs
                without your consent.</p>

            <h2>9. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS</h2>
            <p>As part of our Services, your Personal Data may be transferred to—and maintained
                on—computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental
                jurisdiction. This section outlines the procedures we follow to ensure your data is adequately
                protected during these transfers.</p>

            <h3>9.1 Cross-Border Transfers</h3>
            <p>Your information, including Personal Data, may be transferred to locations outside of your
                jurisdiction, including the United States, which may have different data protection laws than
                those in your home country. If you are located outside the U.S. and provide us with Personal
                Data, you understand that your data may be transferred to and processed in the U.S.</p>

            <h3>9.2 Data Transfer Mechanisms</h3>
            <p>When transferring your Personal Data internationally, we implement adequate safeguards to
                ensure the protection of your information. These safeguards may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Standard Contractual Clauses: We may use standard contractual clauses approved by
                    regulatory authorities to ensure that your data is afforded a similar level of protection as
                    required under your local laws.</li>
                <li>Binding Corporate Rules: In some cases, we may adopt binding corporate rules within
                    our organization to facilitate international transfers while ensuring compliance with
                    applicable data protection laws.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>9.3 User Rights</h3>
            <p>By using our Services, you consent to the transfer of your information to the United States or
                other countries, which may not have the same level of data protection as your jurisdiction. You
                acknowledge that our privacy practices may not be identical to those in your home country, and
                by providing your information, you agree to the processing of your Personal Data in accordance
                with this Privacy Policy.</p>

            <h2>10. HOW WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h2>
            <p>We may store Personal Data during the subscription period and up to 90 days after the
                cancellation of the subscription. Additionally, such information may be stored by third parties to
                whom we may have transferred it under this Privacy Policy. We take what we believe to be
                reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data we collect from loss, misuse, unauthorized use,
                access, inadvertent disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, no network, server, database
                or Internet or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or error-free. Therefore, you should take
                special care in deciding what information you send to us electronically. Please keep this in mind
                when disclosing any Personal Data.</p>
